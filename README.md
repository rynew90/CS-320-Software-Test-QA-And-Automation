1: How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
I can ensure that my code is functional and secure by writing relevant test cases and ensuring that my test coverage is adequate enough to reasonably assume that all bugs and defects have been caught and fixed. I can also ensure that my code is functional and secure by employing automated testing strategies to check for bugs and defects that I may have missed. 

2: How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
I interpret user needs by communicating with the client or customer about what it is they want in the software they need developed. This along with reviewing the requirements documents will help ensure that I fully understand what the needs of the users are. Then I can implement those needs in the code and run tests to ensure that the needs and requirements are met and the program functions within the bounds of the user's needs.

3: How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by beginning with the requirements documents and understanding the user's needs. I then begin to create a framework for the program that is being developed to serve as a guide for what to develop and how to best code it. Finally, I develop the code and test along the way to ensure that the program that I am developing is free of bugs and defects, to the best of my ability.
